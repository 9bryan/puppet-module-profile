# Profile Module #

Profiles are intended to be aggregator Puppet classes that put together utility
modules to construct site-meaningful configurations. They deal with high-level
abstractions and glue them together. Multiple profiles may be deployed to a
single machine. Profiles are often the building blocks of Roles.
